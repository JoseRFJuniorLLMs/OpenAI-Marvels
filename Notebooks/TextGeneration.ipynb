Our team of developers then worked across multiple sprints to roll out amica for use across South Australia, and now across Australia, including the machine learning algorithm that provides a suggested division of a former couple\\'s total assets.Portable has an established legal design practice and we proactively research, co-design and develop new initiatives that make a positive impact in the sector. The design and development of online dispute resolution (ODR) tools which use machine learning algorithms to generate predictions is one of our areas of expertise, exemplified in the product amica (www.amica.gov.au/), a tool which provides a suggested division of assets for separating partners which we launched nationally in July 2020. You can learn how Portable’s new digital platform for separation was conceived, designed and created by the team who brought it to life by watching a recording of a recent webinar with the team who designed and developed amica.In early 2018, the federal government provided funding National Legal Aid to investigate how online dispute resolution could be used to help couples who are separating or divorcing in Australia. The recent challenges and reforms in Family Law highlighted the need to provide more support for people who want to resolve disputes or reach an agreement, without the added cost and complexity of formal legal processes.Disputes arising from the breakdown of a relationship can be particularly expensive for people with relatively few resources, especially for those who don\\'t qualify for legal aid. Often, formalities like parenting plans or property settlement arrangements are ignored until a serious problem arises. The Legal Services Commission of South Australia managed the project on behalf of National Legal Aid, and selected Portable to help realise an idea and create \"a simple, cost-effective and innovative way to negotiate Family Law issues online\".Looking at online dispute resolution was a logical next step for us. After researching the successes and challenges of platforms like MyLaw BC and Rechtwijzer, we saw an opportunity to build an accessible, cost-effective and user-centred method for resolving disputes with technology. A combination of research and informal chats with government clients led us to commence our own internal R&D on what we could do to improve this experience for users. This led to a generic ODR workflow that formed the beginning of our internal R&D process, an early ODR app called ‘Sort’d’. Mapping this dispute resolution workflow opened up the potential for opportunities to better understand the way people communicate in order to put their experience at the centre. ApproachWe initially partnered with the Legal Services Commission of South Australia to develop a prototype to prove that a mobile-first ODR tool can help guide former partners toward an amicable resolution of family law issues. It’s been two years since we started that journey, the project evolved onwards from the prototype and we have now developed an application called ‘amica’ to help separating couples through property settlement and parenting arrangements.We developed amica by working iteratively through different sections of the process with a cross-disciplinary team of researchers, designers, and developers, all in collaboration with the lawyers and the project team at Legal Services Commission of South Australia. Our designers researched existing user stories, relevant legal and jurisdictional constraints, and iterated on our prototypes through multiple rounds of user testing with people who had been through the process before in Adelaide and Melbourne.\\xa0We redesigned the existing DIY Consent Order form provided by the Family Court of Australia to make it an accessible, user-friendly question flow that can be completed on your mobile phone, in your own time. If there\\'s any disagreement between the parties, they can message each other on a guided platform that uses smart technology to prevent abusive language and prompt collaborative responses. We brought our designs to life by building out the technology over multiple series of two-week sprints where we continued to design, develop, test, and refine.\\xa0Alpha and beta testingOur focus on testing with real users of the system informed our design iterations by keeping us focused on designing systems people would want to use. We conducted six rounds of user testing with 34 people on our Alpha and Beta prototypes.We were able to directly test our Beta prototype with some of the same people who participated in the initial interviews. This allowed us to confirm our assumptions and design principles and modify the tone of voice, functionality, and content as needed.We learned that:People want clarity and transparencyPeople need their online experience to integrate with offline services (such as legal and financial advice)People want context and education throughout the processPeople sometimes need a friendly nudgePeople may need an authoritative decision-maker to provide an objective benchmarkPeople want the tone to be authoritative, but not stuffy or legalisticA lot of the feedback we got from users was around how helpful it was to view the process step by step and with plain language text with a conversational user interface. User research and user testing helped to inform the features and functions of the ODR tool. Features and functions of amica include:conversational interface with supportive messaging, updates, and subtle nudges to help people fill out simplified forms and negotiate agreements that work for themcontextual guidance and plain English legal information so people can make informed decisionsdocument uploads to support claims or provide evidence of value for propertysentiment analysis and a \\'tone cop\\' to prevent parties from using abusive or profane languageartificial intelligence provides a suggestion of what a lawyer would consider a fair division of their assets based on the information they’ve entered. Machine learning algorithmWe also worked alongside the Legal Services Commission of South Australia project team to develop a machine learning algorithm that provides a suggested division of a former couple\\'s total assets. Once both parties enter all their assets and liabilities into the tool, they\\'ll see this suggested division as a starting point for their negotiation. When they agree on a fair division of their total asset pool, they can work out the best way to split their assets so they can both walk away with greater financial certainty and independence.Instead of using published case data to power the machine learning algorithm, which we found contained biases due to the contentious nature of the parties\\' disputes, we chose to create a synthetic dataset that included the same variable we\\'d expect to see in our user base, including their respective incomes, number of children, marriage duration, super balances, and an overview of their respective financial contributions to the relationship. We did this by creating a way to crowdsource data from actual lawyers by developing a web interface that provided legal aid family lawyers with hypothetical scenarios that represented the kind of information we’d expect to see from people using the tool. We asked lawyers to assess the hypothetical scenarios, enter a division of assets they\\'d consider fair, and then reset it and continue to fill in the data set using the web tool. By working with National Legal Aid and legal aid bodies in every state and territory, we were able to create a data set to inform our machine learning model. It is currently operating live on amica and provides a suggested starting point to guide former couples in negotiating on the division of their assets.OutcomesOur ODR tool, amica went live in February 2020 with a limited rollout in South Australia. It is now part of a coordinated effort across all legal aid jurisdictions to refer clients and increase their online service delivery.It provides a low-cost alternative to private family lawyers and increases access to legal services for amicable couples who wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford legal help. amica was launched nationally on June 30 by the Federal Attorney-General, Christian Porter, who noted in his press release that:\\xa0\"amica will be a valuable tool to help many couples resolve their disputes between themselves and avoid court proceedings.\"As a result of this launch, people around Australia can use amica instead of paying to see a lawyer, allowing for greater equitability in accessing justice regardless of the income level of those in need of legal support in settling the division of assets and resolving disputes online. As of July 1, 2020 over 200 couples have accessed the service.ResourcesWatch a recording of our recent webinar with the team who designed and developed amicaPortable\\'s press release: \\'New Online Platform for Separating Couples\\'Attorney-General for Australia and Minister for Industrial Relations Media Release (30 June 2020): \\'New ‘amica’ online service to assist couples to separate amicably\\'ABC News article: \\'New online program for couples going through divorce could keep disputes out of court\\'Watch amica project chief and Director of National Legal Aid, Gabrielle Canny\\'s interview on Sunrise (01 July 2020) Listen to an interview with Simon Goodrich, Managing Director of Portable, on 2SER (20 July 2020): \\'Divorce and Separation in the Digital Age\\'Watch amica being featured on The Project, Channel 10 (27 July 2020)Listen to amica project chief and Director of National Legal Aid, Gabrielle Canny\\'s talk on 3AW (04 August 2020): \\'DIY divorce: How artificial intelligence is cutting lawyers out of separation\\'iAward 2020 for Best Government and Public Sector Solutionamica was awarded this national award in November 2020 in recognition of the innovative outcome we achieved by working in partnership with the team at the Legal Services Commission of South Australia.

The work began when Professors \\nKim Clark, Joseph Bower, Jay Light, and John McArth ur took the risk of admitting and financing a \\nmiddle-aged man's way into and through the Harvard Business School's doctoral program in 1989. In \\naddition to these mentors, Professors Richard Rosen bloom, Howard Stevenson, Dorothy Leonard, \\nRichard Walton, Bob Hayes, Steve Wheelwright, and K ent Bowen helped throughout my doctoral \\nresearch to keep my thinking sharp and my standards  for evidence high, and to embed what I was \\nlearning within the streams of strong scholarship t hat had preceded what I was attempting to research.  \\nNone of these professors needed to spend so much of  their busy lives guiding me as they did, and I wil l \\nbe forever grateful for what they taught me about t he substance and process of scholarship. \\nI am similarly indebted to the many executives and employees of companies in the disk drive industry \\nwho opened their memories and records to me as I tr ied to understand what had driven them in the \\nparticular courses they had taken. In particular, J ames Porter, editor of Disk/Trend Report,  opened his \\nextraordinary archives of data, enabling me to meas ure what has happened in the disk drive industry \\nwith a level of completeness and accuracy that coul d be done in few other settings. The model of the \\nindustry’s evolution and revolution that these men and women helped me construct has formed the \\ntheoretical backbone for this book. I hope they fin d it to be a useful tool for making sense of their past, \\nand a helpful guide for some of their decisions in the future. \\nDuring my tenure on the Harvard Business School fac ulty, other colleagues have helped refine this \\nbook’s ideas even more. Professors Rebecca Henderso n and James Utterback of MIT, Robert \\nBurgelman of Stanford, and David Garvin, Gary Pisan o, and Marco Iansiti of the Harvard Business \\nSchool have been particularly helpful. Research ass ociates Rebecca Voorheis, Greg Rogers, Bret Baird, \\nJeremy Dann, Tara Donovan, and Michael Overdorf; ed itors Marjorie Williams, Steve Prokesch, and \\nBarbara Feinberg; and assistants Cheryl Druckenmill er, Meredith Anderson, and Marguerite Dole, have \\nlikewise contributed untold amounts of data, advice , insight, and work. \\nI am grateful to my students, with whom I have disc ussed and refined the ideas put forward in this \\nbook. On most days I leave class wondering why I ge t paid and why my students pay tuition, given that \\nit is I who have learned the most from our interact ions. Every year they leave our school with their \\ndegrees and scatter around the world, without under standing how much they have taught their teachers. \\nI love them and hope that those who come across thi s book will be able to recognize in it the fruits o f \\ntheir puzzled looks, questions, comments, and criti cisms. \\nMy deepest gratitude is to my family—my wife Christ ine and our children Matthew, Ann, Michael, \\nSpencer, and Catherine. With unhesitating faith and  support they encouraged me to pursue my lifelong \\ndream to be a teacher, amidst all of the demands of  family life. Doing this research on disruptive \\ntechnologies has indeed been disruptive to them in terms of time and absence from home, and I am \\nforever grateful for their love and support. Christ ine, in particular, is the smartest and most patien t \\nperson I have known. Most of the ideas in this book  went home on some night over the past five years \\nin half-baked condition and returned to Harvard the  next morning having been clarified, shaped, and \\nedited through my conversations with her. She is a great colleague, supporter, and friend. I dedicate this \\nbook to her and our children.  6  \\nClayton M.

It’s not about the failure of simply any company, but of \\ngood  companies—the kinds that many managers have admire d and tried to emulate, the companies \\nknown for their abilities to innovate and execute. Companies stumble for many reasons, of course, \\namong them bureaucracy, arrogance, tired executive blood, poor planning, short-term investment \\nhorizons, inadequate skills and resources, and just  plain bad luck. But this book is not about compani es \\nwith such weaknesses: It is about well-managed comp anies that have their competitive antennae up, \\nlisten astutely to their customers, invest aggressi vely in new technologies, and yet still lose market  \\ndominance. \\nSuch seemingly unaccountable failures happen in ind ustries that move fast and in those that move \\nslow; in those built on electronics technology and those built on chemical and mechanical technology; \\nin manufacturing and in service industries. Sears R oebuck, for example, was regarded for decades as \\none of the most astutely managed retailers in the w orld. At its zenith Sears accounted for more than 2  \\npercent of all retail sales in the United States. I t pioneered several innovations critical to the suc cess of \\ntoday’s most admired retailers: for example, supply  chain management, store brands, catalogue \\nretailing, and credit card sales. The esteem in whi ch Sears’ management was held shows in this 1964 \\nexcerpt from Fortune:  “How did Sears do it? In a way, the most arresting  aspect of its story is that \\nthere was no gimmick. Sears opened no big bag of tr icks, shot off no skyrockets. Instead, it looked as  \\nthough everybody in its organization simply did the  right thing, easily and naturally. And their \\ncumulative effect was to create an extraordinary po werhouse of a company.” 1 \\nYet no one speaks about Sears that way today. Someh ow, it completely missed the advent of discount \\nretailing and home centers. In the midst of today’s  catalogue retailing boom, Sears has been driven \\nfrom that business. Indeed, the very viability of i ts retailing operations has been questioned. One \\ncommentator has noted that “Sears’ Merchandise Grou p lost $1.3 billion (in 1992) even before a $1.7 \\nbillion restructuring charge. Sears let arrogance b lind it to basic changes taking place in the Americ an \\nmarketplace.” 2 Another writer has complained, \\nSears has been a disappointment for investors who h ave watched its stock sink dismally in the face of \\nunkept promises of a turnaround. Sears’ old merchan dising approach—a vast, middle-of-the-road array \\nof mid-priced goods and services—is no longer compe titive. No question, the constant \\ndisappointments, the repeated predictions of a turn around that never seems to come, have reduced the \\ncredibility of Sears’ management in both the financ ial and merchandising communities. 3  \\nIt is striking to note that Sears received its acco lades at exactly the time—in the mid-1960s—when it \\nwas ignoring the rise of discount retailing and hom e centers, the lower-cost formats for marketing \\nname-brand hard goods that ultimately stripped Sear s of its core franchise. Sears was praised as one o f \\nthe best-managed companies in the world at the very  time it let Visa and MasterCard usurp the \\nenormous lead it had established in the use of cred it cards in retailing. \\nIn some industries this pattern of leadership failu re has been repeated more than once. Consider the \\ncomputer industry. IBM dominated the mainframe mark et but missed by years the emergence of \\nminicomputers, which were technologically much simp ler than mainframes. In fact, no other major \\nmanufacturer of mainframe computers became a signif icant player in the minicomputer business.  8 Digital Equipment Corporation created the minicompu ter market and was joined by a set of other\""
